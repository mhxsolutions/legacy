This is the "Alcoa One Time Inventory" (AITO) web site. Here is the associated email thread for posterity (10/15/2008):

Sorry. Yes. No need to start now and interrupt what you were doing today. Start in the morning or Friday…

Does that mean you want me to start on that?

Sounds good. Something that will work on the screen of the guns.

I could probably have you a web site to do that tomorrow or Friday if that’s what you want me to work on. My intent would be to build a table with a simple, IDENTITY column for its PK and two, string columns up to, say, 100 characters in length. I wouldn’t do any validation other than preventing blank entries. I wouldn’t build any validation. I would just build a single page to do the data entry and the mechanisms necessary to deploy on the server.

1.	New web- internal only
2.	This is a one – time inventory review. They don’t want to write down all the numbers by hand.
3.	I will dump the table they fill to a spreadsheet and email it to them.
4.	End of story

I’m sorry, but without more details I can’t say anything substantive. Some obvious questions that need answering are:

1.	Are we talking about modifying HopsWeb? Or CopsWeb? Or a different site? Or building a new site?
2.	Are we talking about integrating with our current inventory system somehow? Or is this something we host that they use for their internal stuff? Or some new system that doesn’t integrate with our existing tables?
3.	Presumably it’s of no use without some kind of reporting, yes? What reports? What authentication?

I have a request from Alcoa. They would like to use our barcode guns to generate an inventory file. I would have them use the old barcode guns, but I don’t know how to put together that kind of code. 

If you could give me a page we could access from the Guns that would allow the collection of coil number and location. I could design the reporting for them. The location should persist until it is changed by the user. 1. Scan a location tag 2. Scan coil id 3. Enter 4. Scan next coil. Something like that.

The issue is that they are due on the 21st.

Is there any possibility you could put something together without investing too much time?
